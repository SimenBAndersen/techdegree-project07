Twitter Interface

This is the 7th of 12 projects I will complete through Treehouse's Fullstack Javascript techdegree. 

In this project: 
- Build a Twitter interface using Twitter's REST API

Important:
- You'll need your own private keys and access tokens provided by Twitter to use this application. I have not provided these as they are directly connected to my Twitter account. To create your own keys/tokens: https://apps.twitter.com/
